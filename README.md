# MLOps Pipeline for Continuous Training

## 🚀 Project Overview
A fully automated, modular, and scalable MLOps pipeline that supports continuous model training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring — following modern MLOps practices.

## Key Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline with modular components for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and inference
- Automated continuous training pipeline using DVC for dataset and model versioning
- Experiment tracking and model registry using MLflow
- Model deployment via FastAPI for real-time inference
- Model performance monitoring and data drift detection for triggering retraining
- CI/CD friendly structure to support scaling and updates

## Tech Stack
- MLflow (experiment tracking and model registry)
- DVC (data and model versioning, pipeline automation)
- FastAPI (model serving)
- Airflow (optional: for orchestrating pipelines)
- Python (core language)
- Docker (containerization, future-proofing for deployment)
- Pandas, scikit-learn (initial ML models)

## Planned Deliverables
- Fully functional and version-controlled data + model training pipeline
- Integrated MLflow experiment tracking and model registry
- Real-time serving API with FastAPI
- Monitoring module for model performance and triggering retraining
- End-to-end flow demonstrating continuous training from data to deployment

## ✨ Goal
Make this repository a template for any ML project that requires production-level automation and maintenance.

## 📅 Status
🛠️ Initial setup in progress. Pipeline skeletons and first toy model will be added soon.
